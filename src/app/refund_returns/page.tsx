        <p className="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          A major defect is where a product:

          rather than being repaired. Refurbished parts may also be used to
          repair the goods.

          How to Claim a Warranty

        <p className="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Please note that large items must be securely packaged for transit

          We will repair your product wherever possible, which may require
          ordering specific parts to complete the repair. If a repair is not
          feasible, we will replace the product. Depending on the nature of the
          fault, you may also be entitled to a refund or a replacement in line
          with your consumer rights.
