          You have rights under Australian Law if the product you bought has a
          defect. Those rights are summarised below or available via the ACCC
          website.

        <p className="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          If the product has a <strong>minor defect</strong>, Godfreys may

        <p className="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          A major defect is where a product:

          <li>

          still entitled to a refund or replacement at any time. Goods presented
          for repair may be replaced by refurbished goods of the same type
          rather than being repaired. Refurbished parts may be used to repair
          the goods.
